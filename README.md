Overview of the Student Grade Tracker Program

The Student Grade Tracker is a Python program designed to help track and manage student grades efficiently. It provides functionality to input grades, calculate averages, and display results in a user-friendly way.
Key Activities in the Program

1. Data Input:
Users can input grades for various subjects.
The program validates and organizes the data for easy access.
2. Data Storage:
Grades are stored in a dictionary, where the subject is the key, and the grades are stored as a list of values.
3. Grade Analysis:
Calculates the overall average of all grades entered.
Converts the numerical average into a letter grade.
4. User Interaction:
Provides an intuitive menu for navigation (Add grades, View grades, Exit).
Prompts users for input and handles errors like invalid choices.
5. Result Display:
Outputs all grades by subject.
Shows the calculated average and corresponding letter grade in an organized format.

Technologies Used
1. Programming Language:
Python: The program is fully developed in Python, leveraging its simplicity and efficiency for educational purposes.
2. Built-in Python Libraries:
Input/Output Handling: For accepting user inputs and displaying results.
Mathematics Operations: Basic calculations such as summation and averaging are performed using Python's core arithmetic operators.
3. Data Structures:
Dictionary: Used to store and manage grades, with subjects as keys and lists of grades as values.
List: Holds multiple grades for a single subject, allowing flexible data management.
4. Control Structures:
Conditional Statements: Used for determining letter grades based on average.
Loops: Used to navigate the menu and process grades iteratively.
5. Modularity:
